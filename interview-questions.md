# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is a series of command used to create, store, a push code and info to others. Github is the location that can recieve git at a central point making it easy to collabortate with others. 

Researched answer: Git is software used by programmers for developing code together. It helps produce a more fast-past work enviroment for accomplishing products. Github is the "hosting-service" for git software to perfrom.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: The index is the location of where a value sits inside of an area. We also count values noramlly, however index has a starting point of 0 left to right. 

Researched answer: The index is describing the spot or location at which the value is stored. In an array the index,starting from 0, tells us how many units to the right (seperated by a comma) lies the desired value.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays and strings are similar in the aspect that they both store information. Strings do so within '' and arrays inside of ||. They are different because general strings are used for messages and communication and arrays are used for grouping values. However an array can act as a way to store mulitple stings within itself. It can hold different data types as opposed to strings. For example I could have 100 strings and if I ever wanted the same message I would need to retype out that string or assign all 100 to different variables to recall it. I could then take an array and store all 100 of those messages inside and simply pull out a certain message based upon its index number. 

Researched answer:
Some similarites between strings an arrays are that they are both obejects, zero-indexed, and can be iterated over using any type of loop. 
They are different in that strings store charaters, while arrays can store any type of value including strings. Another difference is that once a string is created its length cannot be changed. However, with an array new items can be pushed inside as well as items taken out.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: There are two main roles within paired programming. One individual is the 'driver'. This persons job is to navigate typing out the executing the code. The second person job is to be the navigator. Their responsiblilty is to to walk the driver line-by-line through created the code. Both the driver and navigator can speak up to make changes or give input on better ways to execute the code. 

Researched answer: Pair programming is a technique that developers use to help ensure each line of code is effecient. One person acts as the driver who types out the code as the second person, the navigator, walks them through it. The two roles can be swapped out at any point do to fatigue or even better insight.
